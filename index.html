    Hi, I am Aisha Saleh, a third-year student majoring in Computer Science in the job market.
    I love diving into the details of programs and understanding codes accurately. 
    I prefer to work independently and tend to anticipate all aspects of project development. 
    I joined the Full Stack course because I want to develop my skills in all aspects of building applications, 
    whether from the front-end or the back-end. This will enable me to transform my ideas into integrated projects without having to rely on others.
    I also see that these skills will open up broader opportunities for me in the field of technology and help me deal with technical challenges better,
    which is in line with my desire to work accurately and independently.
